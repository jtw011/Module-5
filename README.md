# Overview

This project's purpose is to help me understand how to use the Rust programming language.

This Project is a simple todo list. It keeps track of a list of tasks, lets you complete them, remove them, add them, and save them. there is also a place to save and exit the program.

I wrote this code to be a better programmer.
